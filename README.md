This project was made as a final project for STATS418.

The link to the data is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

The full work can be viewed by running the flask app in the app folder. 

If you want to see what the app looks like without running any code some sample images are stored in the "images of app" folder

To run the code you will need to have the following packages installed:
 keras
 numpy
 os
 sklearn 
 pandas
 pickle
 flask  
 random
 json
 re
 string
 nltk 
 tensorflow



I apologize for not having them in an easy to use install format. I may update that later but at the moment that is low
on the priority list, and I have limited time.
